/**
 * Ticket Controller
 *
 * Generally speaking, controllers are the middlemen between the front end of
 * the CP/website and your plugin’s services. They contain action methods which
 * handle individual tasks.
 *
 * A common pattern used throughout Craft involves a controller action gathering
 * post data, saving it on a model, passing the model off to a service, and then
 * responding to the request appropriately depending on the service method’s response.
 *
 * Action methods begin with the prefix “action”, followed by a description of what
 * the method does (for example, actionSaveIngredient()).
